    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm a full-stack developer with a love for building software
      and tinkering with new technologies. I enjoy creating applications
      that solve real-world problems and enhance user experiences.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      This summer, I'm taking a fellowship with Meta and MLH, where I will
      be learning more about production engineering to understand how to
      build and maintain large-scale systems. This website is a part of
      that, and also a way for me to showcase my work and share my journey
      with others.
